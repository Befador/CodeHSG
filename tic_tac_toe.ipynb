    "# Tic-Tac-Toe Terminal Edition Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game supporting two modes:\n",
    "- **Single Player:** Play against an AI.\n",
    "- **Pass & Play:** Two players take turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is modularized into multiple cells that define helper functions, game logic, and the main menu. Each function has its own docstring explaining its purpose and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **clear()**:  \n",
    "    Clears the console screen using the appropriate command for the underlying operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **print_board(board, score, players, show_numbers)**:  \n",
    "    Clears the screen and displays the current state of the board, player names, and scores. It can also show cell numbering to help players choose moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **check_win(board, player)**:  \n",
    "    Checks if a player (using symbol `'X'` or `'O'`) has won by evaluating all winning board combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **board_full(board)**:  \n",
    "    Checks if the board is completely filled, indicating no moves remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **get_move(board, player)**:  \n",
    "    Prompts the current player for a move (1-9) or allows exiting by typing 'esc'. The function validates the input and ensures the chosen cell is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing, alpha, beta)**:  \n",
    "    Implements the Minimax algorithm with depth and alpha-beta pruning to determine the optimal move for the AI player.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **best_move(board)**:  \n",
    "    Searches for the best possible move for the AI using the minimax algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ai_move(board)**:  \n",
    "    Determines the AI's move by optionally making a random move (to add unpredictability) or selecting the best move based on a loaded move book and minimax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **play_round(players, single_mode, score, show_numbers)**:  \n",
    "    Manages a single round of Tic-Tac-Toe: updating the board, checking for wins or tie conditions, and updating scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **game_loop(single_mode)**:  \n",
    "    Handles game setup (player names, number of rounds, grid display preferences) and runs multiple rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **main_menu()**:  \n",
    "    Displays the main menu for selecting between single player mode, pass & play mode, or exiting the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI Move Book:**  \n",
    "    The notebook attempts to load an optimal move book from a JSON file (`tictactoe_book.json`). If not found, it falls back to the minimax algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Randomness:**  \n",
    "    A small chance is used to introduce randomness in AI moves to make the gameplay less predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imports:**  \n",
    "    The required libraries (e.g., `os`, `random`, `time`, `shutil`, `json`) are imported once in an earlier cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the game, run the final cell (`if __name__==\"__main__\": main_menu()`). The game will then prompt you to choose a mode and proceed based on your inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!"
